"""Refusal cases for the publisher's report wiring and conditions.

The upload must read the report its own job wrote earlier, in the format
written, and nothing may skip the publisher's work on a push. Each case
changes one thing in the compliant fixture tree and asserts on the one
rule that must refuse it.
