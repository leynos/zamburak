"""Rules for the coverage lanes: pull requests ratchet, main writes the baseline.

generate-coverage saves its ratchet baseline on a push to main, so the

pull-request lane must measure what the publisher measures: a lane
compiling a different selection compares a feature difference, not a
commit difference, and a number comes out either way.
