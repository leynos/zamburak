"""Read a GitHub Actions `if:` condition as a conjunction of whole terms.

A guard is asserted term by term rather than as a substring. A substring
check on `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` accepts
`... && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.event_name == ...`,
which makes every term optional, so a condition carrying an unquoted
`||` is refused outright and the rest is split on `&&`. Both are read
only at parenthesis depth zero: `!(a && b)` is one term, not two, and
`a && (b || c)` is a conjunction whose second term narrows the first.
