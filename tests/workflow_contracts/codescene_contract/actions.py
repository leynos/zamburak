"""Load local composite actions into the shape of the workflows the rules read.

A local action runs in its caller's job, with the caller's secrets, so the
closure follows it as it follows a called workflow. `read_actions` is the
filesystem boundary for actions, as `loading.read_workflows` is for
workflows.

    r"""Parse one local action into the shape of a workflow the rules read.

    A composite action's steps run in its caller's job, so the closure
    rules must read them as they read a called workflow's. The steps become
    one job of a workflow triggered only by `workflow_call`, which no seed
    reading counts, and the rest of the metadata is kept under `action`, so
    a whole-document reading still sees its inputs and any `runs` field.
    Text that `load_workflow` refuses is refused the same way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : str
        The action metadata's YAML text.

    Returns
    -------
    Document
        A workflow-shaped document holding the action's steps.

    Raises
    ------
    WorkflowReadingError
        If the action's `runs` field is not a mapping.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> load_action("runs:\n  using: composite\n  steps: [{run: echo}]\n")["jobs"]

    The key is the path a step names after `./`, such as
    `.github/actions/build`, so the closure can look an action up by the
    reference that runs it. An action this reads nothing for is refused
    where it is called, not here, since a repository need hold none, so an
    absent `.github/actions` reads as no actions. Every directory under it is
    listed explicitly: `Path.rglob` would skip one it cannot list, and an
    action there would then drop out of the closure in silence. A directory
    that cannot be listed, or metadata that cannot be read or parsed, raises
    `WorkflowReadingError` naming it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root : Path
